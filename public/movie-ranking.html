<h3>1. One Pieve</h3>

    <p>
    One Piece is the goat of all the Anime, its called goat piece for a reason. Luffy the goofy bear is a top tier MC and they use the power of friendship to overcome obsticals. Plus there is a cool swordsmen.

<h3>2. Dragon Ball </h3>
    <p>
        This is an OG anime. This Anime inspired the goats. Its about Goku a sayain raised on earth, who uses martical arts - and later god tier techniques to over come strong opponents. 100% give it a watch.
